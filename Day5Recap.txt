11. Write a Syntax to dispaly values from a string array whose names starts with S and Length greater than 5
	foreach(var a in arr)
	{ if a.ToUpper().StartsWith('S') && a.Length > 5)
		{ cw(a);
		}
	}
	
12. Write a Syntax to display all Employees from Employees array whose Designation is Manager

      alpha = 'i'
      int c = o;
      foreach ( var a in str)
		{ 	
			if(a==alpha)
			{
			  c = c+1;
                  }

      cw(c);

14. Draw back of an array
	size is fixed.
	can have ele of one data type only.
	cannot inc or dec array size in runtime

15. What are Collections and why
      IT IS A BUITIN NAMESPACE(COLLECTION OF CLASSES)
	better approach thena array.
	size not fixed.
	can have ele of diff data types.
	
16. Types of Collections
  classes in coll are div into-
	1.	Which work with index
	2.	Which work with key value pair
	3.	Which work with lifo
	4.	Which work with fifo
	5.	Which work with index and key value


17. ArrayList is a Collection class which works with __________-
    index-based

18. Which method is used to add values to a ArrayList
	Add() --> arlst.Add(90); (arlst is the name of arraylist)
      ArrayList to create a collection -> it is a class.
	ArrayList arr = new ArrayList();


19. What is auto implemented collection give syntax
      auto generated by runtime. instead of using arr.Add()
	ArrayList arr = new ArrayList() {'hi' , 89 } --> values automatically fed into the collection and it is created.
    
20. give syntax to display values from ArrayList using forloop
    fot(int i = 0 ; i< arlst.Count ; i++)
	{ cw(arlst[i]; }

21. give syntax to display values from ArrayList using foreach
	foreach(var a in arlst)
	{ cw(a); }
